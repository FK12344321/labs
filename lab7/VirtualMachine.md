## VM installation 
Unfortunately, VirtualBox is not available on Macs with M1 processors, so I used UTM instead. 

To create a vm I installed UTM and then I downloaded an appropriate for my OS .iso file from https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jammy/daily-live/current/ . After that I clicked “Create a new Virtual Machine”. I used the newly downloaded jammy-desktop-arm64.iso image as a base for the new VM. I selected parameters for the vm: 
- 4096 MB of RAM 
- 64 GB of HDD 
- 1 CPU core 
- I used shared network, so traffic is routed directly by the host operating system and the guest 

I confirmed the parameters of the vm and it got created 

Here it is:
